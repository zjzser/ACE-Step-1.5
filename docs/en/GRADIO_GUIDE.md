---

## Service Configuration

### Model Selection

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Checkpoint File** | Select a trained model checkpoint (if available) |
| **Main Model Path** | Choose the DiT model configuration (e.g., `acestep-v15-turbo`, `acestep-v15-turbo-shift3`) |
| **Device** | Processing device: `auto` (recommended), `cuda`, or `cpu` |

### 5Hz LM Configuration

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **5Hz LM Model Path** | Select the language model. **Available models are filtered by your GPU tier** — e.g., 6-8GB GPUs only show 0.6B, while 24GB+ GPUs show all sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, 4B). |
| **5Hz LM Backend** | `vllm` (faster, recommended for NVIDIA with ≥8GB VRAM), `pt` (PyTorch, universal fallback), or `mlx` (Apple Silicon). **On GPUs <8GB, the backend is restricted to `pt`/`mlx`** because vllm's KV cache is too memory-hungry. |
| **Initialize 5Hz LM** | Check to load the LM during initialization (required for thinking mode). **Automatically unchecked and disabled on GPUs ≤6GB** (Tier 1-2). |

> **Adaptive Defaults**: All LM settings are automatically configured based on your GPU's VRAM tier. The recommended LM model, backend, and initialization state are pre-set for optimal performance. You can manually override these, but the system will warn you if your selection is incompatible with your GPU.

### Performance Options

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Use Flash Attention** | Enable for faster inference (requires flash_attn package) |
| **Offload to CPU** | Offload models to CPU when idle to save GPU memory. **Automatically enabled on GPUs <20GB.** |
| **Offload DiT to CPU** | Specifically offload the DiT model to CPU. **Automatically enabled on GPUs <12GB.** |
| **INT8 Quantization** | Reduce model VRAM footprint with INT8 weight quantization. **Automatically enabled on GPUs <20GB.** |
| **Compile Model** | Enable `torch.compile` for optimized inference. **Enabled by default on all tiers** (required when quantization is active). |

> **Tier-Aware Settings**: Offload, quantization, and compile options are automatically set based on your GPU tier. See [GPU_COMPATIBILITY.md](GPU_COMPATIBILITY.md) for the full tier table.

### LoRA Adapter

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **LoRA Path** | Path to trained LoRA adapter directory |
| **Load LoRA** | Load the specified LoRA adapter |
| **Unload** | Remove the currently loaded LoRA |
| **Use LoRA** | Enable/disable the loaded LoRA for inference |

> **⚠️ Note:** LoRA adapters cannot be loaded on quantized models due to a compatibility issue between PEFT and TorchAO. If you need to use LoRA, set **INT8 Quantization** to **None** before loading the adapter.

### Initialization

Click **Initialize Service** to load the models. The status box will show progress and confirmation, including:
- The detected GPU tier and VRAM
- Maximum allowed duration and batch size (adjusted dynamically based on whether LM was initialized)
- Any warnings about incompatible settings that were automatically corrected

After initialization, the **Audio Duration** and **Batch Size** sliders are automatically updated to reflect the tier's limits.

## LoRA Training

The LoRA Training tab provides tools for creating custom LoRA adapters.

> 📖 **For a comprehensive step-by-step walkthrough** (data preparation, annotation, preprocessing, training, and export), see the [LoRA Training Tutorial](./LoRA_Training_Tutorial.md).

### Dataset Builder Tab

#### Step 1: Load or Scan

**Option A: Load Existing Dataset**
1. Enter the path to a previously saved dataset JSON
2. Click **Load**

**Option B: Scan New Directory**
1. Enter the path to your audio folder
2. Click **Scan** to find audio files (wav, mp3, flac, ogg, opus)

#### Step 2: Configure Dataset

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dataset Name** | Name for your dataset |
| **All Instrumental** | Check if all tracks have no vocals |
| **Custom Activation Tag** | Unique tag to activate this LoRA's style |
| **Tag Position** | Where to place the tag: Prepend, Append, or Replace caption |

#### Step 3: Auto-Label

Click **Auto-Label All** to generate metadata for all audio files:
- Caption (music description)
- BPM
- Key
- Time Signature

**Skip Metas** option will skip LLM labeling and use N/A values.

#### Step 4: Preview & Edit

Use the slider to select samples and manually edit:
- Caption
- Lyrics
- BPM, Key, Time Signature
- Language
- Instrumental flag

Click **Save Changes** to update the sample.

#### Step 5: Save Dataset

Enter a save path and click **Save Dataset** to export as JSON.

#### Step 6: Preprocess

Convert the dataset to pre-computed tensors for fast training:
1. Optionally load an existing dataset JSON
2. Set the tensor output directory
3. Click **Preprocess**

This encodes audio to VAE latents, text to embeddings, and runs the condition encoder.

### Train LoRA Tab

#### Dataset Selection

Enter the path to preprocessed tensors directory and click **Load Dataset**.

#### LoRA Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **LoRA Rank (r)** | 64 | Capacity of LoRA. Higher = more capacity, more memory |
| **LoRA Alpha** | 128 | Scaling factor (typically 2x rank) |
| **LoRA Dropout** | 0.1 | Dropout rate for regularization |

#### Training Parameters

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Learning Rate** | 1e-4 | Optimization learning rate |
| **Max Epochs** | 500 | Maximum training epochs |
| **Batch Size** | 1 | Training batch size |
| **Gradient Accumulation** | 1 | Effective batch = batch_size × accumulation |
| **Save Every N Epochs** | 200 | Checkpoint save frequency |
| **Shift** | 3.0 | Timestep shift for turbo model |
| **Seed** | 42 | Random seed for reproducibility |

#### Training Controls

- **Start Training** - Begin the training process
- **Stop Training** - Interrupt training
- **Training Progress** - Shows current epoch and loss
- **Training Log** - Detailed training output
- **Training Loss Plot** - Visual loss curve

#### Export LoRA

After training, export the final adapter:
1. Enter the export path
2. Click **Export LoRA**

#### Performance notes (Windows / low VRAM)

On Windows or systems with limited VRAM, training and preprocessing can stall or use more memory than expected. The following can help:

- **Persistent workers** – Epoch-boundary worker reinitialization on Windows can cause long pauses; the default behavior has been improved (see related fixes) so stalls are less common out of the box.
- **Offload unused models** – During preprocessing, offloading models that are not needed for the current step (e.g. via **Offload to CPU** in Service Configuration) can greatly reduce VRAM use and avoid spikes that slow or block preprocessing.
- **Tiled encode** – Using tiled encoding for preprocessing reduces peak VRAM and can turn multi-minute preprocessing into much shorter runs when VRAM is tight.
- **Batch size** – Lower batch size during training reduces memory use at the cost of longer training; gradient accumulation can keep effective batch size while staying within VRAM limits.

These options are especially useful when preprocessing takes a long time or you see out-of-memory or long pauses between epochs.

## Tips and Best Practices

### For Best Quality

1. **Use thinking mode** - Keep "Think" checkbox enabled for LM-enhanced generation
2. **Be specific in captions** - Include genre, instruments, mood, and style details
3. **Let LM detect metadata** - Leave BPM/Key/Duration empty for auto-detection
4. **Use batch generation** - Generate 2-4 variations and pick the best

### For Faster Generation

1. **Use turbo model** - Select `acestep-v15-turbo` or `acestep-v15-turbo-shift3`
2. **Keep inference steps at 8** - Default is optimal for turbo
3. **Reduce batch size** - Lower batch size if you need quick results
4. **Disable AutoGen** - Manual control over batch generation

### For Consistent Results

1. **Set a specific seed** - Uncheck "Random Seed" and enter a seed value
2. **Save good results** - Use "Save" to export parameters for reproduction
3. **Use "Apply These Settings"** - Restore parameters from a good batch

### For Long-form Music

1. **Set explicit duration** - Specify duration in seconds
2. **Use repaint task** - Fix problematic sections after initial generation
3. **Chain generations** - Use "Send To Src" to build upon previous results

### For Style Consistency

1. **Train a LoRA** - Create a custom adapter for your style
2. **Use reference audio** - Upload style reference in Audio Uploads
3. **Use consistent captions** - Maintain similar descriptive language

### Troubleshooting

**No audio generated:**
- Check that the model is initialized (green status message)
- Ensure 5Hz LM is initialized if using thinking mode
- Check the status output for error messages

**Poor quality results:**
- Increase inference steps (for base model)
- Adjust guidance scale
- Try different seeds
- Make caption more specific

**Out of memory:**
- The system includes automatic VRAM management (VRAM guard, adaptive VAE decode, auto batch reduction). If OOM still occurs:
- Reduce batch size manually
- Enable CPU offloading (should be auto-enabled for GPUs <20GB)
- Enable INT8 quantization (should be auto-enabled for GPUs <20GB)
- Reduce LM batch chunk size
- See [GPU_COMPATIBILITY.md](GPU_COMPATIBILITY.md) for recommended settings per tier

**LM not working:**
- Ensure "Initialize 5Hz LM" was checked during initialization (disabled by default on GPUs ≤6GB)
- Check that a valid LM model path is selected (only tier-compatible models are shown)
- Verify vllm or PyTorch backend is available (vllm restricted on GPUs <8GB)
- If the LM checkbox is grayed out, your GPU tier does not support LM — use DiT-only mode
